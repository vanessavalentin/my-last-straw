        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350°F (175°C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully bake.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 8: </strong> Cool completely before serving.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 9: </strong> <em><strong>Enjoy!</strong></em></p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To make the crust: Butter a 9-inch springform pan — choose one that has sides that are 2 3/4 inches high (if the sides are lower, you will have cheesecake batter left over) — and wrap the bottom of the pan in a double layer of aluminum foil.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Stir the crumbs, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Pour over the melted butter and stir until all of the dry ingredients are uniformly moist. (You can do this with your fingers.) Turn the ingredients into the springform pan and use your fingers to pat an even layer of crumbs along the bottom of the pan and about halfway up the sides. Don’t worry if the sides are not perfectly even or if the crumbs reach above or below the midway point on the sides. Put the pan in the freezer while you heat the oven. (The crust can be covered and frozen for up to 2 months.)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Center a rack in the oven. Heat the oven to 350 degrees and place the springform on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Set the crust aside to cool on a rack while you make the cheesecake.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> To make the cheesecake: Put a kettle of water on to boil.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the cream cheese at medium speed until it is soft and creamy, about 4 minutes. With the mixer running, add the sugar and salt and continue to beat for another 4 minutes or so, until the cream cheese is light. Beat in the vanilla. Add the eggs, one by one, beating for 1 full minute after each addition — you want a well-aerated batter. Reduce the mixer speed to low and stir in the sour cream and/or heavy cream.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Put the foil-wrapped springform pan in a roasting pan that is large enough to hold the pan with some space around it. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 8: </strong> Give the batter a few stirs with a rubber spatula, just to make sure that nothing has been left unmixed at the bottom of the bowl, and scrape the batter into the springform pan. The batter will reach the rim of the pan. (If you have a pan with lower sides and have leftover batter, you can bake the batter in a buttered ramekin or small soufflé mold.) Put the roasting pan in the oven and pour enough boiling water into the roaster to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 9: </strong> Bake the cheesecake for 1 hour 30 minutes, at which point the top will be browned (and perhaps cracked) and may have risen just a little above the rim of the pan. Turn off the oven’s heat and prop the oven door open with a wooden spoon. Allow the cheesecake to luxuriate in its water bath for another hour</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> After 1 hour, carefully pull the setup out of the oven, lift the springform pan out of the roaster — be careful, there may be some hot water in the aluminum foil — and remove the foil. Let the cheesecake come to room temperature on a cooling rack</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 11: </strong>When the cake is cool, cover the top lightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, although overnight is better.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 12: </strong>At serving time, remove the sides of the springform pan — you can use a hairdryer to do this — and set the cake on a serving platter.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 8: </strong> Cool completely before serving.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 9: </strong> <em><strong>Enjoy!</strong></em></p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To make the crust: Butter a 9-inch springform pan — choose one that has sides that are 2 3/4 inches high (if the sides are lower, you will have cheesecake batter left over) — and wrap the bottom of the pan in a double layer of aluminum foil.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Stir the crumbs, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Pour over the melted butter and stir until all of the dry ingredients are uniformly moist. (You can do this with your fingers.) Turn the ingredients into the springform pan and use your fingers to pat an even layer of crumbs along the bottom of the pan and about halfway up the sides. Don’t worry if the sides are not perfectly even or if the crumbs reach above or below the midway point on the sides. Put the pan in the freezer while you heat the oven. (The crust can be covered and frozen for up to 2 months.)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Center a rack in the oven. Heat the oven to 350 degrees and place the springform on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Set the crust aside to cool on a rack while you make the cheesecake.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> To make the cheesecake: Put a kettle of water on to boil.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the cream cheese at medium speed until it is soft and creamy, about 4 minutes. With the mixer running, add the sugar and salt and continue to beat for another 4 minutes or so, until the cream cheese is light. Beat in the vanilla. Add the eggs, one by one, beating for 1 full minute after each addition — you want a well-aerated batter. Reduce the mixer speed to low and stir in the sour cream and/or heavy cream.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Put the foil-wrapped springform pan in a roasting pan that is large enough to hold the pan with some space around it. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 8: </strong> Give the batter a few stirs with a rubber spatula, just to make sure that nothing has been left unmixed at the bottom of the bowl, and scrape the batter into the springform pan. The batter will reach the rim of the pan. (If you have a pan with lower sides and have leftover batter, you can bake the batter in a buttered ramekin or small soufflé mold.) Put the roasting pan in the oven and pour enough boiling water into the roaster to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 9: </strong> Bake the cheesecake for 1 hour 30 minutes, at which point the top will be browned (and perhaps cracked) and may have risen just a little above the rim of the pan. Turn off the oven’s heat and prop the oven door open with a wooden spoon. Allow the cheesecake to luxuriate in its water bath for another hour</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> After 1 hour, carefully pull the setup out of the oven, lift the springform pan out of the roaster — be careful, there may be some hot water in the aluminum foil — and remove the foil. Let the cheesecake come to room temperature on a cooling rack</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 11: </strong>When the cake is cool, cover the top lightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, although overnight is better.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 12: </strong>At serving time, remove the sides of the springform pan — you can use a hairdryer to do this — and set the cake on a serving platter.</p>
